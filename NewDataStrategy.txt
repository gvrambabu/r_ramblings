I am looking to create the following presentation, be a critique and suggest the following 

1. any changes to the presentation content to make it more credible 
2. create a FAQ on top of this for who does not understand the depth of this content, and  also for someone who is skeptical  
3. generate Mermaid charts mark ups friendly on the 3 of the following scenarios (a) current state to target state (b) data technology ecosystem (c) design principles 

Here’s the **technically rich and brutally honest version** of your presentation narrative. This delivers a strategic, no-nonsense message that a leadership team and technical audience will respect:

---

## **Brutal Audit**

* **You created a Data Swamp, not a Lake**: 500 apps pushing 10,000 bespoke feeds is uncontrolled entropy. Your data sources and lake tried to centralize chaos, not solve it. It’s failed to meet even basic consumer requirements.
* **Compute-close-to-storage was a buzzword, not an implementation**: The architecture design never made it to production reality. The compute stayed near process, because the lake was always a bottleneck.
* **Your org is spending to duplicate garbage**: Multiple teams redundantly store the same operational data, with zero standardization. That’s waste multiplied by fragility.
* **No one trusts the data lineage or definitions**: Referential integrity breaks, formats differ, sources are unclear. You can’t fix governance post-factum.
* **You scaled complexity, not solutions**: The strategy increased cost, latency, and internal confusion.


---

## **Blind Spots & Risks**

* **You're underestimating how entrenched the old flows are**: Business processes are duct-taped to legacy feeds. Kill them, and you break things.
* **Data contracts are political**: Producers will resist being held accountable unless enforced by exec-level alignment and incentives.
* **APIs don’t fix modeling**: GraphQL won’t save you from weak ontology or inconsistent definitions.
* **Mesh ≠ Magic**: A Data Mesh is still a mess without clear ownership, SLA enforcement, and decentralized governance that *actually works*.
* **Retiring the Lake sounds simple—until audit, risk, and regulators block the move because lineage is unclear.**

---

## **Ruthless Priorities**

1. **Kill the Feed Factory**: Freeze creation of any new bespoke feeds. Enforce mandatory migration of top-20 highest-traffic feeds to Productized APIs.
2. **Enforce Ownership & SLA by Design**: Each Data Product has an owner, a lineage trace, and an SLA-based contract. No contract = no data.
3. **Ontology First, API Later**: Define and enforce clear data element ontologies before exposing anything via GraphQL or Kafka. Model before you code.

---

## **Speed & Energy Fixes**

* **Do War Rooms for Feed Consolidation**: Run 2-week “kill and migrate” cycles. Cross-functional. Ruthless execution.
* **Shift Budget from Infra to Governance**: Cut 15% of infra ops budget and reassign it to modeling, data definition, and product management.
* **Automate Data Contracts with Self-Service Portals**: No Slack pings. No Excel. Either you onboard through the contract portal or you don’t ship.

---

## **Next Check-in Question**

> “What % of our data exchange volume is governed by active, enforced data contracts?”

---

## **Presentation Content (Strategic Deck Style)**

### 1. **Opening**

* “Today’s ecosystem is not scalable, not trustable, and not efficient.”
* “Our new strategy delivers clarity, accountability, and velocity.”

---

### 2. **Why the Current State is Broken**

* Architecture: Monolithic lake model lacks flexibility and doesn’t meet latency/lineage needs.
* Operations: Every app is a snowflake, every feed is a liability.
* Governance: Duplicates, data drift, and zero control.

---

### 3. **The New Data Ecosystem**

**Three Layers:**

* **Data Products (Mesh)**: Own, versioned, contract-driven.
* **Data Services/APIs**: Access abstracted by orchestration, not piping.
* **Catalog/Store**: Visibility, searchability, lineage-aware registry.

---

### 4. **Data Delivery Model**

* **Formats**: LinkFormat, Object, Tabular — standard schema-based interfaces.
* **Modes**: Real-Time Streams (Kafka), Snapshots (Batch), Historic (Time-Series APIs).
* **API Standards**: GraphQL-first with optional JSON and Kafka Async Streams.

---

### 5. **Contract-Driven Distribution**

* Contracts include: Data Element Dictionary, SLA, Security Controls.
* Logical vs. Physical Datasets are mapped explicitly.
* Lineage is enforced at point of publication.

---

### 6. **Security & Governance**

* Auth at contract level (OAuth2 + fine-grained scopes).
* Data access via GraphQL introspection for scoped views.
* Complete auditability by dataset and user.

---

### 7. **Separation of Concerns**

* Storage: Retired Lake, replaced with composable, scalable object & grid storage.
* Compute: On-demand via existing Grid and containerized flows.
* Decoupled deploys of services and products.

---

### 8. **Retirement Strategy**

* Target: Sunset 80% of bespoke feeds in 12 months.
* Migration roadmap: Top 50 feeds first, prioritize by duplication and SLA failures.
* Success metric: Cost to deliver 1 dataset reduced by 70%.

---

### 9. **OKRs**

| Objective         | Key Result                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Kill legacy feeds | 80% decommissioned in 12 months           |
| Enforce contracts | 100% of new products have data contracts  |
| Improve trust     | 90% drop in data defect escalations       |
| Time-to-data      | New product delivery under 3 weeks        |
| Infra ROI         | 40% drop in storage and ETL cost per feed |

---

### 10. **Punchlines That Land**

* “No more data waterfalls. We stream what matters.”
* “We don’t ship feeds. We ship contracts.”
* “Governance without code is just theater.”
* “If it’s not productized, it doesn’t exist.”
* “Data Mesh is not a philosophy here. It’s a kill-switch.”

This diagram could be improved by layering in *roles or system actors* like producers, consumers, and orchestration platforms. Would you like me to enhance it with those next?
