Gemini : 

Here is a High-Level Functional Specification for the Strategic Trade Management Platform (STMP). This document is designed to guide the architecture of a unified, cross-asset derivative system comparable to industry leaders like Murex MX.3, Calypso, and proprietary stacks like J.P. Morgan’s Athena or Bank of America’s Quartz.
High-Level Functional Specification: Strategic Trade Management Platform (STMP)
1. Common Trade Capture
The Common Trade Capture module serves as the centralized ingestion gateway for all derivative transactions across FX, Rates, Credit, and Muni desks. Its primary architectural goal is to decouple execution venues from downstream processing by normalizing diverse trade feeds—whether from electronic communication networks (ECNs) like Bloomberg and Tradeweb, voice brokers, or direct dealer-to-client platforms—into a unified internal representation. This module must implement a flexible product taxonomy capable of representing complex instruments, from simple FX Spots to exotic Interest Rate Swaptions and Muni Total Return Swaps, without requiring schema changes for every new product variant. Borrowing from the design philosophy of platforms like Calypso, the capture mechanism will utilize a component-based trade definition (e.g., legs, schedules, barriers) rather than rigid product templates, ensuring that the system can quickly adapt to market innovations.
Furthermore, this module acts as the first line of defense for data integrity. Upon entry, every trade undergoes rigorous syntactic and semantic validation against static reference data and risk limits. This includes checking counterparty eligibility, credit line availability, and ensuring that trade economics comply with ISDA definitions. For manual bookings, the User Interface (UI) will mirror the "smart blotter" concept seen in Athena, where inputs are reactive—updating defaults and valid ranges in real-time based on the selected instrument type and currency pair. This ensures that the captured trade is not just a record of a transaction, but a fully validated, risk-ready object compliant with standard protocols such as FpML or ISDA CDM (Common Domain Model).
2. Life Cycle Management (LCM) and Trade Model Integration
The Life Cycle Management module acts as the deterministic state machine for the platform, managing the evolution of a trade from inception to maturity. Unlike legacy systems that often treat lifecycle events as mere data updates, this module treats events—such as Novations, Terminations, Rate Resets, Option Exercises, and Compression cycles—as first-class citizens. Each event triggers a precise transition in the trade’s status and version, ensuring a clear audit trail. This module must support complex corporate action processing specifically for the Muni and Credit desks, handling unique events like bond calls, defeasance, or credit events that trigger CDS settlements. The system will automate these processes based on the economic definitions of the trade, reducing manual touchpoints and operational risk.
Crucially, this module integrates tightly with the bank’s Quantitative Analytics libraries. Drawing on the "dependency graph" architecture popularized by Quartz and Athena, the LCM module does not merely store static data; it maps trade attributes dynamically to the underlying pricing models. When a trade is captured or modified, the system automatically identifies which pricing models and risk factors are dependencies. This ensures that a change in a trade’s state (e.g., an amendment to a notional schedule) instantly propagates to the risk engine, triggering a recalculation of Greeks and sensitivities without batch processing. This live linkage ensures that the "booking model" and the "valuation model" remain perfectly synchronized, eliminating the common reconciliation breaks found in split-architecture environments.
3. Blotter and Position Management
The Blotter and Position Management module provides the operational dashboard for traders, risk managers, and middle office staff. It is designed to offer a real-time, aggregated view of risk and P&L, capable of slicing and dicing data across arbitrary dimensions—by desk, portfolio, trader, strategy, or counterparty. This module moves beyond simple row-based reporting to provide a hierarchical, tree-based view of positions, allowing users to drill down from a global desk view into individual trade legs. For the Rates and FX desks, where volume is high, the blotter must support high-frequency updates via WebSocket streaming, ensuring that the Position Keeper reflects the current state of the market and the book with sub-second latency.
Functionally, this module manages the "Inventory" logic. It distinguishes between different views of the same position: the "Legal View" (what is signed with the counterparty), the "Risk View" (how the sensitivity is hedged), and the "Funding View" (cash flow implications). It supports on-the-fly aggregation of delta, gamma, and vega, and facilitates "What-If" scenarios where traders can simulate the impact of a potential block trade on their overall book structure. This module also handles the complexity of P&L Attribution (PAA), breaking down daily P&L into explainable factors (e.g., time decay, spot move, vol surface shift), which is a critical feature for the Muni and Credit desks where illiquidity often masks the true source of profit or loss.
4. Workflows and Exception Management
This module serves as the orchestration engine for the platform, enforcing the bank's standard operating procedures through a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) compliant engine. It governs the Straight-Through Processing (STP) rules that determine whether a trade flows automatically to the back office or requires manual intervention. The system defines distinct workflow topologies for different asset classes; for instance, a vanilla FX Spot may follow a "no-touch" workflow, while a complex structured Muni deal may require a multi-stage approval workflow involving Credit Risk, Legal, and Compliance sign-offs. This mimics the configurability of Murex's workflow engine, allowing the bank to modify approval hierarchies without code deployments.
Exception management is centralized here to prevent operational bottlenecks. Instead of burying errors in log files, the module generates actionable "Tasks" for exception queues. If a trade fails validation or a downstream confirmation system rejects a message, the workflow engine flags the specific trade, identifies the owner, and assigns a remediation task. This includes sophisticated "4-eye check" logic for manual amendments, ensuring that any modification to a verified trade requires approval from a second authorized user. The module provides a complete audit history of who touched a trade, when, and why, satisfying the stringent regulatory requirements for swap dealers.
5. SoR (System of Record) Data Store for Trade Events
The SoR Data Store is the immutable backbone of the platform, designed to provide a trusted "Golden Source" for all transaction data. To support the rigorous demands of regulatory reporting and audit, this module employs a bitemporal data model. This means every record stores two timelines: "Valid Time" (when the business event occurred) and "Transaction Time" (when the record was entered into the system). This allows the bank to query the database to answer complex questions such as "What did we think our risk was on March 31st, as viewed on April 5th?" This capability is essential for restating financials or investigating historical trade disputes.
Architecturally, the SoR utilizes an Event Sourcing pattern. Rather than simply overwriting the current state of a trade when an update occurs, the system appends a new event to the trade's history log. The "current state" of a trade is derived by replaying these events. This ensures that no data is ever lost and provides native support for "Time Travel" debugging, a feature highly prized in platforms like Athena. The data store is optimized for both high-throughput write operations (to handle bursty market activity) and complex analytical queries, likely utilizing a hybrid storage strategy that combines high-performance in-memory caching for active trades with columnar storage for historical analytics.
6. Multi-Entity Support
In a global banking environment, a "desk" is rarely a single legal entity. The Multi-Entity Support module manages the complex web of internal booking models, allowing the platform to serve multiple branches and subsidiaries simultaneously. It maintains a distinct separation between the "Trader" (who executes the risk) and the "Legal Entity" (where the risk sits). This module automates the generation of inter-affiliate trades, or "Back-to-Back" bookings. For example, if a trader in London executes a USD/JPY swap on behalf of the Tokyo branch, this module automatically books the market-facing trade in Tokyo and simultaneously books a mirror internal trade to transfer the risk to the London risk book, handling all necessary transfer pricing and internal margin logic.
This functionality extends to managing the "Books and Records" hierarchy. It allows for the configuration of "Virtual Portfolios" that span multiple legal entities for management reporting, while strictly enforcing entity-level segregation for regulatory capital and tax reporting. This is particularly critical for the Muni desk, where tax implications vary significantly by jurisdiction and entity. The module ensures that global trades respect local compliance rules—such as Dodd-Frank for US entities and EMIR for European entities—by applying entity-specific validation rules at the moment of trade capture.
7. Observable Reference Data
The Observable Reference Data module creates an abstraction layer between the trade economics and the volatile market data used to value them. Instead of hardcoding rate fixings or counterparty details into the trade record, the trade refers to semantic objects—such as "USD-LIBOR-3M Curve" or "Counterparty X Credit Spread." This module manages the lifecycle of this static and market data, ensuring that trades are always pointing to the correct version of a curve or static record. It handles the complexity of "Market Data Sets" or "Environments," allowing the same trade to be valued using "Official EOD" data, "Intraday Real-Time" data, or "Stressed Scenario" data without modifying the trade object itself.
For the derivative products in scope, this module is responsible for constructing and maintaining the complex multi-dimensional surfaces (volatility surfaces, credit curves, inflation curves) required for pricing. It includes a "mark-to-market" snapshotting mechanism that freezes the observable data used for official P&L generation, creating a permanent link between a specific P&L number and the exact market data inputs used to derive it. This traceability is a key requirement for the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), ensuring that the bank can prove the provenance of every valuation input.
