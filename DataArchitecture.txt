Focusing a little bit on Data Mesh, and Data Vault mostly applicable for a large scale enterprise self-serv data platform‚Äôs.

Think about it: if we're not familiar with the fundamental concepts of IaC, Data Mesh, and Data Vault, we might underestimate their significance. They aren't just tools you pick up; they are guiding principles that shape our approach and can take a long time to truly internalize and implement effectively. It's the kind of knowledge that, in retrospect, often leads to the thought, "We should have done this better from the start."

However, the principles of Data Mesh and Data Vault go far beyond immediate tactical wins. They often get overlooked in favor of intermittent solutions and short-term gains. But I firmly believe that understanding the underlying philosophy and having a specific methodology or approach aligned with these principles is what truly fuels the long-term growth of a ‚Äúlarge scale enterprise data platform‚Äù, moving it from a basic state to a mature and scalable level.
There's no magic bullet that guarantees the "best" outcome. 

But simply grasping the core ideas of Data Mesh (decentralized ownership, data as a product) and Data Vault (robust, auditable modeling) is a significant win for developing an enterprise architecture mindset. Implementing these principles today or tomorrow is secondary to the foundational understanding they provide.


Connecting the Dots: Medallion, Data Vault, and Star/Snowflake

For those thinking about implementing a Data Lakehouse architecture (like the Medallion framework), it's crucial to understand how Data Vault and dimensional modeling fit in:

- Bronze Layer (~ Raw Vault): Ingest raw data with minimal transformation, mirroring the Hubs, Links, and Satellites of a Raw Data Vault.

- Silver Layer (~ Business Vault): Apply business logic, creating enriched attributes, derived columns (Business Satellites), Point-in-Time (PIT) tables, and Bridge tables, extending the Raw Vault.

- Gold Layer (~ Information Marts): Build consumption-ready data marts optimized for specific business needs. This is where Star and Snowflake schemas come into play, providing performant and user-friendly structures for BI tools and analytics, derived from the Business Vault.

#RawData ‚Üí #Bronze (Raw Vault) ‚Üí #Silver (Business Vault) ‚Üí #Gold (Star/Snowflake Marts). 

Data Vault provides the robust and auditable foundation, while Star/Snowflake schemas deliver the speed and usability for end-user consumption. Modern tools like dbt often facilitate this transformation, with separate models for the Vault layers and the Mart layers.

I can‚Äôt appreciate enough the core initial data platform architecture diagram Deepak Bhardwaj drew ‚úä, which I later zoomed into to map Data Vault and Medallion layers.ü´≥
