1. 7500 feeds , 400 systems —> 150 data sets (standard) with 8 / 10 APIs 
2. No consistent data model - language 
3. 9 different business functions (consumers) and provide data (concept to provisioning) within 3 weeks : 6 months 
4. 15 data aggregators, 50 different data distributors :: 


You are the CDO of the Business Division and presenting key strategic changes you are doing like below. 
What is your presentation deck that delivers the key messages below ? 


Currently 

* 500 applications exchanging 10000 bespoke data feeds
* Strategy to consolidate all in one Data Lake did not work. It is not able to solve  consumer needs , is often incomplete, late and has slower time to market for delivering data 
* Lot of consumers end up storing same data on their end as Operational Data and further distributing downstream 
* Duplication issues as same Transactional Data is being exchanged in different formats leading to data Defects, referential integrity and lineage issues 
* Design was to take Compute closer to the Storage (Lake) but rarely that was applied as other solutions closer to the Process 
* inconsistent across different Data Products that are serving different consumers 
* Investment costs & operational costs have been prohibitively higher than desired 

Your strategy : 

* Data Eco System will be formulated as 3 layers (starting with Data Products in a Data Mesh, then second laryer as Data Services/API/Orchestration, and on top layer is Catalog/Store)  
* 3 Types of Data Formats (LinkFormat, Object, Tabular) 
* Downstream consumers are provided the data as Real Time Stream, Snapshot, Historic 
* Data is registered as Logical and then as Physical Data Sets, with clear defintions of Data Elements, Ontology 
* Data exchange is agreed as a Contract between Data Product to the Consumer with lineage established to the Source feeding to the Data Product 
* Controls and Access / Authorization is enforced at the Contract level with specific Data Sets in question 
* upon invoking these Data Distribution APIs, they return GraphQL based data Elements, or all JSON elements & or as Async Kafka Stream  
* Clearly Segreagte Storage and Compute services, and leverage existing Compute from Grid 
* Retiring legacy Data Lake and bespoke Feeds will be done with Products, abstracted by Services.  

Generate a presentation that has 
* an  outline of the presentation
* Functional and Non-Functional Design principles 
* What are the key changes and why these will yield positive results 
* OKRs to measure the success  
* important punch lines that elevate the presentation and the value 



# Agentic AI 4-Eye Check Approaches

## Human-in-the-Loop Transaction Validation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines multiple approaches to integrate Agentic AI into the existing 4-eye check process, creating intelligent, adaptive approval workflows while maintaining critical human oversight and control.

## Current State vs. Agentic Future

### Traditional 4-Eye Check

```
Transaction → Primary Human → Secondary Human → Approval/Rejection
```

### Proposed Agentic Approaches

Multiple models that enhance decision-making while preserving human authority.

-----

## Approach 1: AI-Augmented 4-Eye Check

*Enhancement Model - Keep existing structure, add AI intelligence*

### Architecture

```
Transaction → AI Pre-Analyzer → Enhanced Primary Human → AI Validator → Enhanced Secondary Human → Decision
```

### Key Features

- **AI Pre-Analysis**: Risk scoring, compliance checking, anomaly detection
- **Context Enhancement**: Provide humans with AI insights, similar transactions, risk factors
- **Decision Support**: Real-time recommendations without replacing human judgment
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI provides confidence levels for its analysis

### Implementation

```yaml
workflow_config:
  stages:
    - stage: "ai_pre_analysis"
      agent: "risk_assessment_agent"
      output: "risk_score, compliance_flags, anomalies"
    - stage: "primary_human_review"
      input: "transaction + ai_insights"
      actor: "primary_approver"
    - stage: "ai_validation"
      agent: "validation_agent"
      output: "consistency_check, additional_risks"
    - stage: "secondary_human_review"
      input: "transaction + all_previous_insights"
      actor: "secondary_approver"
```

### Benefits

- Maintains existing approval authority
- Enhances human decision quality
- Reduces review time through intelligent pre-processing
- Builds trust gradually through transparent AI recommendations

### Decision Matrix

```
AI Consensus + Human Consensus = Auto-Approve
AI Concerns + Human Approval = Human Override (Logged)
AI Approval + Human Concerns = Human Veto (Escalated)
AI Concerns + Human Concerns = Auto-Reject/Escalate
```

## Approach 3: Adaptive Confidence-Based Workflow

*Dynamic Approval Paths*

### Concept

The system adapts approval requirements based on AI confidence and risk levels.

### Workflow Variations

#### High Confidence, Low Risk

```
Transaction → AI Agent → Single Human Review → Auto-Approve
```

#### Medium Confidence, Medium Risk

```
Transaction → AI Agent → Primary Human → AI Validator → Secondary Human → Decision
```

#### Low Confidence, High Risk

```
Transaction → AI Agent → Primary Human → Secondary Human → AI Escalation → Senior Human → Decision
```

#### Exceptional Cases

```
Transaction → AI Agent → Multi-Human Committee → AI Synthesis → Executive Review → Decision
```

### Configuration

```yaml
confidence_thresholds:
  high: 0.95
  medium: 0.75
  low: 0.60

risk_thresholds:
  low: 100000
  medium: 1000000
  high: 10000000

workflow_rules:
  - condition: "confidence > 0.95 AND risk < 100000"
    workflow: "fast_track"
    approvers: 1
    ai_agents: ["analysis_agent"]
    
  - condition: "confidence > 0.75 AND risk < 1000000"
    workflow: "standard"
    approvers: 2
    ai_agents: ["analysis_agent", "validation_agent"]
    
  - condition: "confidence < 0.75 OR risk > 1000000"
    workflow: "enhanced_review"
    approvers: 3
    ai_agents: ["analysis_agent", "validation_agent", "governance_agent"]
```

def hybrid_decision_logic(transaction, human_decisions, ai_decisions):
    if human_decisions.unanimous_approve() and ai_decisions.no_red_flags():
        return "APPROVED"
    elif human_decisions.unanimous_reject() or ai_decisions.critical_issues():
        return "REJECTED"
    elif human_decisions.split() and ai_decisions.concerns():
        return "ESCALATE"
    else:
        return "HUMAN_OVERRIDE_REQUIRED"
```

### Agent Roles

## Governance & Risk Management

### Human Authority Preservation

- **Veto Power**: Humans can always override AI decisions
- **Escalation Rights**: Any human can escalate any decision
- **Audit Trail**: Complete decision history with reasoning
- **Responsibility Clarity**: Clear ownership of final decisions

### Risk Mitigation

```yaml
risk_controls:
  ai_decision_limits:
    - maximum_transaction_size: 500000
    - restricted_counterparties: "high_risk_list"
    - asset_class_limitations: "approved_instruments_only"
  
  human_oversight:
    - mandatory_human_review: "transactions > threshold"
    - random_sampling: "10% of ai_decisions"
    - pattern_monitoring: "unusual_ai_behavior"
  
  escalation_triggers:
    - ai_uncertainty: "confidence < 0.75"
    - conflicting_decisions: "human_ai_disagreement"
    - regulatory_flags: "compliance_concerns"
```

### Compliance Framework

- **Regulatory Alignment**: Ensure AI decisions meet regulatory requirements
- **Audit Readiness**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails
- **Bias Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for discriminatory patterns
- **Model Governance**: Version control, testing, and validation procedures

- Focus on high-volume, low-complexity transactions
- Gather learning data

### Phase 3: Adaptive Confidence-Based System (Long Term)

- Deploy Approach 3 with learned confidence models
- Dynamic workflow selection
- Full human-AI collaboration

### Success Metrics

```yaml
kpis:
  efficiency:
    - processing_time_reduction: "target: 40%"
    - straight_through_processing: "target: 60%"
    - human_workload_optimization: "target: 30% reduction"
  
  quality:
    - decision_accuracy: "target: 99.5%"
    - false_positive_rate: "target: <2%"
    - human_override_frequency: "target: <5%"
  
  risk:
    - error_detection_rate: "target: >95%"
    - compliance_violation_prevention: "target: >99%"
    - audit_readiness_score: "target: >95%"
```

The key is starting with human-centric AI augmentation and gradually evolving toward true human-AI collaboration while maintaining strict governance and the ability to revert to human-only processes when needed.
