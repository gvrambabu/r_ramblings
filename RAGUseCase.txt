Subject: Let’s Turn Our Data Chaos Into Order – The AI Way

Hi [Business/Technology Executive],

We’ve got a beast to tackle—400+ applications, 8,000+ feeds, and a transformation journey that’s about to take us on a wild ride. The survey we rolled out painted the picture: we’re swimming in bespoke feeds with mismatched formats, names, and exchange methods (files, Message Bus, you name it). Sound familiar?

Now, the mission is clear: we define standardized datasets and APIs, break down those custom silos, and bring order to the chaos. But here’s the kicker—getting developers and product teams to embrace this new world, update their codebases, and rally around the flag will take years (and, let’s be real, maybe a couple of gray hairs).

What If We Didn’t Do It the Hard Way?

Picture this: instead of slogging through manual migrations and endless meetings, we bring in Generative AI to be our MVP. Here’s how we can make it happen:
	1.	AI That Gets the Job Done:
	•	Think of a Generative AI agent that scans through our feeds, maps them to the new standards, and flags what needs fixing—like a super-smart intern that never sleeps.
	•	It can even suggest reusable fields and clean up redundancies while you sip your coffee.
	2.	Power to the People (or Devs):
	•	Developers and PMs get an AI copilot embedded right into their tools, nudging them towards best practices, generating documentation on the fly, and making migration as painless as possible.
	•	No more guesswork. Just plug and play.
	3.	Productivity on Steroids:
	•	Automation means we’re not just moving faster; we’re moving smarter. What could take years might now take months—with fewer headaches and way more efficiency.

Why It Matters
	•	$5M+ Savings: That’s no small change. By ditching brute force for AI power, we save big on time and resources.
	•	Speed Like a Startup: What used to be a marathon is now a sprint. Let’s ship this transformation faster.
	•	Teams That Love Their Tools: Empowered people = better adoption = a smoother transition.

Why Now?

We’re at a crossroads. This transformation is kicking off, and this is the perfect time to inject some Silicon Valley magic into our strategy. Waiting means we keep grinding the hard way—missing the chance to set ourselves up with a scalable, AI-first foundation.

Let’s Make It Happen

How about we:
	1.	Pull together for a session with key stakeholders to hash out how this fits into our roadmap.
	2.	Pilot the AI-powered approach on a subset of feeds and let the results do the talking.

This isn’t just a cool idea—it’s a game-changer for how we tackle complexity and make our transformation actually enjoyable.

Let me know when we can jam on this further.

Here’s an example you can weave into the email to illustrate the problem and how the AI agent can help:

Let’s Paint a Picture

Imagine this:
	•	We have an Interest Rate Swap trade feed in FpML format that looks something like this:

<Trade>  
  <TradeHeader>  
    <TradeId>IRS12345</TradeId>  
    <Party>PartyA</Party>  
    <Party>PartyB</Party>  
  </TradeHeader>  
  <InterestRateSwap>  
    <FixedRate>2.5%</FixedRate>  
    <FloatingRateIndex>LIBOR</FloatingRateIndex>  
    <NotionalAmount>1000000</NotionalAmount>  
  </InterestRateSwap>  
</Trade>  

	•	Now compare that to an Equity Derivative trade feed that’s in a CSV format like this:

TradeID	Ticker	Counterparty	Notional	Price
EQD67890	AAPL	PartyC	5000000	145.25

Both describe trades, but they couldn’t be more different in terms of structure, naming conventions, and data exchange method.

Now enter the magic of the ISDA Common Domain Model (CDM):
	•	Both feeds can be translated into a standardized JSON format like this:

{  
  "tradeId": "IRS12345",  
  "productType": "InterestRateSwap",  
  "parties": ["PartyA", "PartyB"],  
  "notional": 1000000,  
  "terms": {  
    "fixedRate": 2.5,  
    "floatingRateIndex": "LIBOR"  
  }  
}  

{  
  "tradeId": "EQD67890",  
  "productType": "EquityDerivative",  
  "parties": ["PartyC"],  
  "notional": 5000000,  
  "ticker": "AAPL",  
  "price": 145.25  
}  

How the AI Agent Can Help

Without automation, the process to migrate these feeds to the new standard would require:
	•	Manual mapping of fields like TradeID to tradeId or Notional to notional.
	•	Resolving structural differences (XML vs. CSV) into a single JSON format.
	•	Endless back-and-forth between product teams, developers, and data architects.

With a Generative AI Agent:
	1.	The agent analyzes both feeds, identifies patterns, and automatically suggests the mappings to the ISDA CDM JSON format.
	2.	It flags discrepancies (e.g., a missing party in the equity feed) and proposes fixes.
	3.	It generates the required transformation code and documentation for developers to apply.
	4.	Developers can query the agent directly: “How do I map floating rate indexes to the CDM?” or “Show me an example JSON for equity derivatives.”

The Outcome

Instead of taking weeks to manually standardize each feed, the AI agent transforms this into a self-service, accelerated workflow for teams, enabling them to focus on innovation rather than grunt work.

Adding this example not only makes the concept relatable but also demonstrates the real-world inefficiency and how AI can directly address it.
